# How to Extract Better Examples from Your Corpus

## Problem
The current genre examples (Funk, Blues, Disco, etc.) are **AI-generated templates** that don't showcase real Strudel patterns or musical compositions.

## Solution
Replace generic genre templates with **excerpts from actual songs** in `music/strudel-songs-collection/`.

## Method

### 1. Identify Good Excerpts
Look for songs with interesting patterns:
- `ameliewaltz.js` - Beautiful waltz with chords
- `pyramidsong.js` - Complex Radiohead arrangement  
- `mammalschilling.js` - Orchestral arrangement
- `bluemonday.js` - New Order synth patterns
- `enjoythesilence.js` - Depeche Mode
- `happybirthdayramones.js` - Punk rock
- `clubbed.js` - Electronic dance
- `tarantella.js` - Traditional Italian dance

### 2. Extract Meaningful Sections
Instead of showing entire songs, extract representative patterns:

```javascript
// Good: Extract a memorable riff or pattern
stack(
  n("[0@2 ~, ~ [[1,2,3] ~]!2]")
  .chord("<[Dm Am]!2 [F C]!2>/4")
  .voicing().velocity(0.5),
  // ... melodic line
)
```

### 3. Categorize by STYLE, not GENRE
- "Waltz Pattern" (from ameliewaltz.js)
- "Arpeggio with Voicing" (from bigship.js)
- "Complex Polyrhythm" (from breakfastline.js)
- "Synth Lead" (from bluemonday.js)
- "Harmonica Melody" (from ameliewaltz.js)

### 4. Keep Original Attribution
Always credit the original song and composer in the example metadata.

## Why This is Better
✅ Shows REAL Strudel usage patterns
✅ More musically interesting
✅ Demonstrates actual techniques
✅ Credits real artists
✅ No "fast hard drum beats" generated by AI
